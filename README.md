## Face Recognition App

[Test face recognition app here!](https://facial-recognition-frontend.herokuapp.com/)

This application uses the PERN stack and uses an API from Clarifai to detect faces on a picture. It can register new users and store them to a database so they can login whenever. The Front end is connected to the backend and the backend is connected to the database. The server can be found [here] (https://github.com/zs1046/ServerAPI). All three components are running on Heroku.

Work needed:
- Add detection for multiple faces
- Fix background
